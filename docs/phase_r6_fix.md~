# BADGR_BOT Phase R6: INP Missing Metric Resilience Patch  
**Author:** Ch405_L9 (Chaos)  
**Date:** 2025-10-28  
**Branch:** badgr-bot-r6-inp-fix  
**Status:** Verified Stable  

## Overview
This patch resolves a fatal interruption in the Lighthouse audit pipeline when the `interaction-to-next-paint` (INP) metric is missing or unavailable. Previously, `to_row()` raised an exception that prevented CSV generation.  

The R6 patch ensures graceful handling of missing metrics while preserving valid data across all other categories.

---

## Root Cause
The original `to_row()` implementation called `safe_num()` without providing a default fallback for INP.  
When Lighthouse skipped the metric, the resulting `NoneType` caused a failure during CSV row construction.

---

## Resolution
- Added robust default handling for missing metrics in `src/main.py`
- Updated `to_row()` to always emit a complete record even if one or more metrics are unavailable  
- Ensured `"N/A"` is written to CSV/Markdown outputs for missing values  
- Verified that `robots_guard` skip logic continues unaffected

## Verification
**Test Command**
```bash
cd ~/for-git/badgr_bot
./scripts/run.sh
tail -n +1 outputs/csv/results.csv
